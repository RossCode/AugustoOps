## ⏳ PENDING - Frontend & Integration (Phases 4-9)

### Phase 4: Frontend Components
Create:
- `client/src/components/ReportReview.tsx`
- `client/src/components/ReportPreview.tsx`
- `client/src/api/reports.ts`
- `client/src/types/reports.ts`

Update:
- `client/src/components/Projects.tsx` - Add Reports tab
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Add routes
- `client/src/components/Header.tsx` - Add navigation

### Phase 5-9: PDF, n8n, Email, Permissions, UI Polish

---

## 📝 Key Decisions

1. **Recipients**:
   - Internal recipients reference `augusto_team_members`
   - External recipients stored per project
   - Report PM stored in `augusto_project_data`

2. **Scheduling**:
   - n8n handles cron scheduling
   - Standard times: Tuesday 10 AM (weekly/bi-weekly), day after first Monday (monthly)

3. **PDF**: Use Puppeteer for HTML → PDF

4. **Email**: SendGrid recommended, configured in n8n

---

## 🚀 To Resume

Simply say: "Continue implementing status reports - create the route files for Phase 2"

The database schema is complete and ready. Next step is to create the two route files (`reports.js` and `webhooks.js`) and register them in `server/index.js`.
